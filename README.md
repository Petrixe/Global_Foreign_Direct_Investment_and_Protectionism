# Global FDI Dashboard and Policy Analysis (1970–2024)

This repository contains an interactive Excel dashboard and a professional report analysing global foreign direct investment (FDI) and protectionist policies. The project focuses on real FDI net inflows in constant 2024 USD, compares nominal versus real series, and relates FDI volatility to global inflation. The goal is to demonstrate a clean analytical workflow, from raw data to clear insights.

## Project Summary

This project analyses global net inflows of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and global inflation between 1970 and 2024 using manually cleaned and transformed macroeconomic data. The work focused on building a structured, Excel-based dashboard that displays dynamic relationships among nominal and real FDI, long-term growth trends, and inflation cycles. All calculations, including constant-USD conversion, rolling averages, CAGR, and YoY changes, were created through classical Excel formulas without automation tools. The goal was to translate complex time-series data into a clear visual narrative confirming how major global events and crises shaped investment patterns.

## Skills Applied

The analysis was executed entirely in Microsoft Excel using core analytical functions. PivotTables were used to aggregate and summarise long-run data, and dynamic line and column charts were built to visualise volatility, rolling averages, and inflation effects. The project demonstrated strong command of data transformation, formula design, and dashboard structuring. Analytical interpretation followed a macroeconomic, data-to-insight approach, linking quantitative movements to historical and policy developments rather than simply describing figures. The work also reflects applied reporting and presentation skills through structured storytelling, chart design, and consistency in layout and logic.

## Skills Strengthened

This project significantly deepened proficiency in economic interpretation, Excel modelling, and visual storytelling. It strengthened the ability to design a multi-layer dashboard (data → calculation → visualisation) while maintaining clarity and narrative flow. The process reinforced key analytical habits — precision in transformation, disciplined structuring of data models, and independence in managing complex analytical tasks without automated tools. Beyond technical growth, it improved soft skills in scope management, consistency, and self-directed problem solving, mirroring a real analytical workflow from raw data to actionable insight.
